# Alpha-PM Docker Compose
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose up -d      # Start all services
#   docker-compose logs -f    # View logs
#   docker-compose down       # Stop all services
#
# Note: MongoDB is hosted on MongoDB Atlas (cloud), not locally.
#       Only Redis runs locally for caching and pub/sub.
